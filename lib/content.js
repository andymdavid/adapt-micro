The automations that handle routine work. The agents that draft, summarize, and follow up. The workflows that connect systems end-to-end. The tools that replace messy spreadsheets and manual processes.

**Without this layer, even the best leadership teams hit a ceiling.** They're still stuck doing work that could run itself.`,
